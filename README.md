# Flagel Lab Behavior Analysis-Python
This repository will be used in the Flagel Lab for analyzing output from MEDAssociates Operant Chambers. 

## Background
The Flagel Lab studies the biological basis of reward and motivated behaviors in preclinical rodent models, primarily 
with a focus on attribution of incentive salience to a cue ('sign-tracking'). 
We study this behavior using a Pavlovian Conditioned Approach paradigm in MEDAssociates Operant Chambers, where a lever 
cue is a predictor of reward. Sign-trackers preferentially interact with the lever, while goal-trackers interact with 
the reward location.
Additionally, a Conditioned Reinforcement test is sometimes used to examine incentive value of the lever following PavCA
training.
